_Back to [Index](../index.html)_

It's been a while since the last time I posted something here. I figure many
of you are probably having the same struggle as me: you just started your own
blog, you wanted to write everyday, and being **extremely** ambitious about your
blog, and suddenly you stop. And forgot about it. And maybe you start going to
YouTube or Facebook or whatever you use these days, and before you know it,
your blog is dead. Once you realized it, you're thinking like: no one was going
to read my blog anyway.

When I make this post, I have no idea what I'm gonna write about, but I know
that I need to write something, and sometimes I'm just stuck. So in this post,
you'll find with me what it takes to keeping a blog up. This post is gonna be
about how to figure out what to write and how, and also some tips and tricks
on how to keep your blog running, instead of writing on it once and let it
collect dust. It's worth mentioning that I have _no idea_ how this post gonna
turn out, and I'm going to research as I write.

## Let's get started

First things first. I have no idea how to write blogs, let alone how to turn it
into a _habit_. Fortunately, we can just search it.

![Google Search: how to write a blog](/img/google_search/how-to-write-a-blog.png)

I'm going to try to use the top-most tip from Google Search, from 
[www.writersdigest.com](http://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/the-12-dos-and-donts-of-writing-a-blog),
so let's try that one out.

#### 1. Find your focus

Alright, so I need to find who my target audiences are. I'm trying to write for
people who wanted to start their career on computers, and programming, and
what-not. But if I can't even write (properly) myself, there's no way I can
write a blog for people to understand, nor to convey the meaning. Nevertheless,
I should focus more on techy stuffs. But I'll let several posts like these slip
by. Otherwise I wouldn't have anything to write nor would I develop my skills to
write.

#### 2. Be relatable, be yourself

When I first write this blog, I have no idea in what tone should I make the
posts. So... I ended up writing _too_ formally, and that's bad. This is
**interesting** and I should try more of this. So I guess from now on, you'll
be reading the posts in my tone: casually, just like how we would if we were to
chat.

#### 3. Use links within your posts

They say that including links would help, so
[here](http://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/the-12-dos-and-donts-of-writing-a-blog)
it is. It's the same _writersdigest_ link as above, but now you don't have to
scroll.

#### 4. Include images

If you've read my post about
[markdown](how-to-write-blogs-without-any-code-a-beginners-guide-to-markdown)
you'll see that I've included cat pictures. Well, I guess too many of them
_does_ hurt. By the way I got the pictures (like the one on the top)
from www.pexels.com. They offer high quality license-free images so
definitely check it out! Alternatively, you could go to Google Image,
DeviantArt, etc, but _please_ make sure you're **allowed** to use that image.
Some images are copyrighted and should not be used unless you got written
permission from said author.

#### 5. Respond to blog comments

I'd really love it if you post comments after reading this. But since this post
is made entirely on Github, and there's no server that handles comments, **do**
comment [here](https://github.com/Charon77/charon77.github.io/issues/2)
on this post's issue.

#### 6. Post to Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Anywhere Else You Can

I'm actually nervous everytime I write something and I have to post it, but
without it, how else would you find this post.

Alright, that's a lot, just from one site, but soon you'll notice that if you go
to other websites, they'll have a lot of tips in common. From here on, you
should continue looking for other people's tips and tricks on how to write
blogs.

## Making it a habit

Now that you've reached here, you should already familiar on what to write, how
to get images, links, etc. But making blog-writing a habit is a _totally_
different challenge.

![coffee](/img/stock/pexels-attractive-bar-barista-296888.jpg)

When I hear the word "habit", it's definitely coffee. I drink coffee twice a
day, not only because I needed the caffeine boost, but also because I enjoy it.
When I was young, coffee was a stranger to me. I knew it existed, but I don't
drink coffee _regularly_ until I do. And when I do, I do.

It sounds weird, but to me, habit is something that you do regularly until you
totally forgot about it. At first, writing blog posts looks like a chore, but
once you are _used_ to it, it's like how you unconsciously post your meal on
Instagram.

... At least, that's what I hope. I am **NOT** there yet. I still struggle to
write my blog posts. Heck, this is like my third post, so what do I know?

So I went to Google

![Google Search: how to make writing a blog a habit](/img/google_search/how-to-make-writing-a-blog-a-habit.png)

And I'll just follow the first result on Google Search, from [huffingtonpost](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-deyoung/8-steps-to-starting-a-wri_b_4724235.html).

Point _numero uno_ hits me hard.

**PRIORITY...**

Usually, when I was bored, I'd browse Facebook, or watch YouTube. and I mean,
while this is okay, I don't know how many hours I was on YouTube looking for
videos that interest me. The problem is, sometimes **I don't even enjoy**
the videos I was watching, and there I was, blindly watching YouTube videos that
I don't enjoy watching just to kill time, or scrolling down the never-ending
Facebook news feed.

I **COULD** have written stuffs here instead. I didn't know that I could kill
time by writing and it would have been more rewarding, because at the end of the
day, I **produce** something.

By the way, the rest of the article on [huffingtonpost](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-deyoung/8-steps-to-starting-a-wri_b_4724235.html)
is good, so check it out.

## Takeaways

So, to wrap up, here's the things you can learn from here:

1. Look up how to write. There's nothing shameful for you to search things that
seem obvious, because you may have missed something.

2. Think of writing as a fun activity, not a chore. You started a blog because
_you_ liked it. It's unlikely that you started a blog because you don't want to
write. I know, sometimes you don't feel like writing and want to do other
stuffs, and it's **okay**. The [huffingtonpost](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-deyoung/8-steps-to-starting-a-wri_b_4724235.html)
article says that you don't automatically stop writing for the rest of your life
if you skip a day or two doing the things you enjoy. You'll eventually get back
to it.

Hopefully this lesson encourages you to write more. It ain't easy, but we'll
get to it.
