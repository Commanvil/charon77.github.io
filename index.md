Hello, and welcome.

First of all, thank you for reaching this page. I am truly excited for
what I am sharing with you.

We often try to learn something, looking at tutorials everywhere, and
sometimes, they feel too complicated. I'm sure you all have felt that too.
As it turns out, in my experience, nothing should ever feels _that_ hard.
Developers often write bad codes, worse documentations, and terrible tutorials.
As we progress, we realize that more and more obstacles turns out to be _super_
easy, once
you got the hang of it. Every challenges will get easy after you know the reasoning behind
their design, their stuctures, their motivation, as well as their design
philosophy.

I dislike how simple concepts turn complicated to newcomers. That is why
I've gathered a collection of "tutorials". I personally do not want to call
them tutorials. Think of them more like _toys_; something you play
and have fun with. While you need to know how they work and why do people design
them as such, there's essentially no goals other than to be able to play them. These _toys_
are something you can try with ease, to help you get up and running based on my personal
experiences and from the websites I've stumbled upon. I would like to share the
thinking experience, so that you feel accomplished after playing with soem of them.

Here you will find list of programs, tools, or even concepts. Inside each of them,
you will find summaries of what they are, why should / shouldn't you play with them,
as well as instructions on how to use them; what they can and cannot do.
These documents are not made for full-fledge references, but more as a guide book,
as well as tips and tricks that may not seem obvious at a glance.

I hope these articles would help you start out something fresh and fun,
without the intimidating fear of difficulties.
